# Group: <your-group-name>
# Slot: <your-slot-name>

<!--
  Use the short form for the group name — i.e. `Telegram`, `Whisper.cpp`,
  `Gemini Live STT` — not `Group Telegram`. The slot is the lowercase
  identifier from the table in GROUPS.md, e.g. `telegram`, `whisper_cpp`,
  `gemini_live_stt`.

## What this PR adds

For a channel slot:

- [ ] `glc/channels/catalogue/<slot>/adapter.py` — `on_message` + `send`
- [ ] `glc/channels/catalogue/<slot>/schemas.py` — channel-specific types (if any)
- [ ] All 7 tests at `tests/channels/test_<slot>.py` pass

For a voice provider slot:

- [ ] `glc/voice/{stt,tts}/providers/<slot>/adapter.py` — `transcribe` or `synthesize`
- [ ] `glc/voice/{stt,tts}/providers/<slot>/schemas.py` — provider-specific types (if any)
- [ ] All 7 tests at `tests/voice/{stt,tts}/test_<slot>.py` pass

## Demo

<!-- REQUIRED. Link to the YouTube/Loom/Vimeo demo showing your
     adapter handling a real upstream message end to end (NOT just the
     mock). The CI tests run against the mock; the demo is how you
     prove the real wire path works. -->

## Wire-format quirks you hit

<!-- 2-4 sentences. What was surprising about this slot's wire format,
     auth model, rate-limit behaviour, or trust posture? -->

## Tests-included checklist

- [ ] All 7 tests in `tests/.../test_<slot>.py` pass locally
- [ ] `ruff check <owned_path>` is clean
- [ ] `mypy <owned_path>` is clean
- [ ] Adapter does **not** hold long-lived credentials in code or env files
- [ ] For channel slots: adapter consults `glc.security.trust_level.classify()` before constructing the envelope
- [ ] For channel slots: adapter respects the channel's `allowed_senders` setting
- [ ] No imports from LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or Open Interpreter
