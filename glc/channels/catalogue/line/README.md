# LINE Messaging API

This is a **group assignment** in Session 11. Implement the line adapter
to make the test suite at `tests/channels/test_line.py` pass.

## What you build

Two files under this directory:

- `adapter.py` — subclass `glc.channels.base.ChannelAdapter` and implement
  `on_message(raw) -> ChannelMessage` and `send(reply) -> Any`.
- `schemas.py` — any channel-specific Pydantic types you need.

## Required environment variables

- `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`

## Free-tier limits

Developer trial: 500 free push messages/month; reply messages within the 1-hour reply token are unlimited.

## Wire-format quirks to expect

Reply tokens are one-shot and expire fast — push messages cost against the monthly quota. Signed webhook validation uses the channel secret.

## Tests you need to pass

The failing tests live at `tests/channels/test_line.py`. They cover:

1. `on_message` builds a valid `ChannelMessage` for owner and stranger inputs.
2. Trust level resolves to `owner_paired` / `user_paired` / `untrusted` correctly.
3. `send` produces a valid wire-format payload and reaches the mock.
4. The adapter handles forced disconnects without raising.
5. Rate-limit responses propagate to the caller as a 429.
6. In public channels with the default `mention_only_in_public: true`, the
   adapter consults the allowlist before processing strangers.

The mock-API fake at `tests/channels/mocks/line_mock.py` is your contract
surface. Do **not** edit the mock or the test file — they are fixed.

## Submission

Open a PR that:

- Adds your `adapter.py` and `schemas.py`.
- Passes `pytest tests/channels/test_line.py`.
- Updates `CLAIMS.md` if you have not already claimed this channel.
