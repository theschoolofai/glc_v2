"""Channel-specific Pydantic types for the discord adapter.

These mirror the slices of the Discord gateway / REST wire format the
adapter actually reads. The canonical cross-channel envelope
(ChannelMessage / ChannelReply) lives in glc.channels.envelope; these
types only model Discord's own shapes so on_message() can parse a
MESSAGE_CREATE dispatch frame with validation instead of raw dict
indexing.
