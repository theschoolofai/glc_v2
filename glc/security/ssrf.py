"""SSRF guards for server-side URL fetches (C1 #14/#75, #92).

The LLM plane fetches caller-supplied image URLs and inlines them as
data: URLs before handing them to a provider. Without a guard, a caller
can point those URLs at internal services (cloud metadata endpoints,
loopback admin ports, RFC1918 hosts) and use the gateway as a confused
deputy. Redirects make an allowlist on the literal URL insufficient — a
public host can 302 to ``http://169.254.169.254/``.

This module resolves the host to concrete IPs, rejects any address that
is private / loopback / link-local / reserved (IPv4 *and* IPv6), and
provides a fetch wrapper that follows redirects manually so every hop is
re-validated.

Validate-then-``httpx.get(hostname)`` is a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU: the
safety check can see a public A record while the subsequent connect
resolves to a private IP. Fetches therefore pin the validated IP at the
**transport/connection** layer while keeping the request URL hostname
intact so TLS SNI and certificate verification still use the logical
name (HTTP ``Host`` stays correct as well).
